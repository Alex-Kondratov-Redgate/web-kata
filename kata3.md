# React App Kata 3

Code for **Kata 3** is available in the `app3` folder.

## Learning aims

The idea here is enforce the concept of a `state`, callbacks and React lifecycles in React.


## Task

Write the JavaScript/React code to: 

* Filter products by name
* Show/Hide product descriptions

### Filter products:
1. Add a `Form` to filter products within the `filter-products` div. It should contain:
    * `label` for product name
    * `input` for filtering by name
2. Add a handler function for the `onChange` event of the form. The function should:
    * save the product `name` from the event in a `state` property.
3. Filter products in the `render` method based on filter input.
    * you could you [filter](http://underscorejs.org/#filter) to do this.
