# React App Kata 5

Code for **Kata 5** is available in the [app5](app5) folder.

## Learning aims

Up to now all data work has used the `data.js` file to focus on frontend work.
We are now moving the data to a backend server.
The idea here is to learn how a web app can interact with a backend server through REST API calls.

## Task

You are given a server that exposes the following REST endpoints.

Write the JavaScript/React code to: 

* List all products in home page when the app is loaded.
* Navigate to each product page
* Have hard links on products names
* Request product details when someone selected a products.
* Changes to the data should persist through sessions:
    * Be able to remove a product
    * Be able to add a product
    * If you refresh the browser product changes should persist (this was not the case before)
