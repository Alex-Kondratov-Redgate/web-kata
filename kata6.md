# React App Kata 6

Code for **Kata 6** is available in the [app6](app6) folder.

## Learning aims

The idea here is to continue to switch our app to use Redux.

## Requirements

* [dotnet core v2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

## Get started

You will need **2** terminals

1. Web API server
    * go to `./app6`
    * verify dotnet version `dotnet --version` is `2.0.0`
    * run `dotnet restore`
    * run `dotnet build`
    * run `dotnet run`

    This should build the web api server and serve it at `http:\\localhost:5000`
1. Web app

* in another terminal
* go to `./app6/app/`
* follow the instructions in the [README](README.md#run-the-app).
* your app should be running at port **3000**
